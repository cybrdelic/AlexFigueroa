## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm Alejandro Figueroa, a Full-Stack Developer specializing in creating fully autonomous software systems. Currently employed at TalentNow, I'm on a professional team of software engineers and QA testers, working on a multi-million dollar B2B SaaS project servicing Fortune 50 companies in multi-tenant talent management and analytics. 

My unique contribution to the tech industry lies in my quest to fully automate the entire end-to-end software development lifecycle (from idea to continuous deployment and iteration), with a focus on self-improving and adaptive systems. All of my projects are open-source, adhering to my belief in decentralization and the distribution of access to solutions.

## 🛠 Skills

- **Languages**: Python, Shell, TypeScript, Bash
- **Technologies**: Docker, React, GraphQL, Apollo, Flask, Django
- **Methodologies**: Infrastructure as Code, Agile, Test-Driven Development

## 🚀 Projects

- [Python-spin-up](https://github.com/cybrvybe/python-spin-up): A CLI tool for streamlining Python project creation.
- [RunDBFast](https://github.com/cybrvybe/rundbfast): Effortlessly spin up databases for rapid prototyping and consistent dev setups.
- [WorkspaceAutomator](https://github.com/cybrvybe/workspace-automator):  A tool for autonomous daily setup of your work environment and workspace/monitor setup.
- [CodebaseUtils](https://github.com/cybrvybe/codespace_utils): A shared util library for handling common developer tasks, like copying the simplified, relevant codebase directory tree to the clipboard to paste into LLMs.
- [WindowsPowershellScripts](https://github.com/cybrvybe/powershell-windows-automation-scripts): A shared script library for handling basic, recurrent windows tasks, such as setting up your dev environment on your local, via installations, etc, as well as some docker debugging scripts.

## 📈 Goals

- **Short-Term**: Create a suite of automation tools designed to accelerate all aspects of software development.
- **Mid-Term**: 
  - Develop a CLI tool using these automation tools that takes an idea through research, requirements breakdown, and ticket handling.
  - Create another CLI tool that takes tickets as input and autonomously implements, tests, and deploys solutions.
- **Long-Term**: 
  - Merge these systems into a cohesive, self-improving, fully autonomous system for end-to-end software development and continuous autonomous deployment and iteration.
  
  Additional aspirational goals include:
  
  - Pioneering cutting-edge technologies.
  - Launching an autonomous civilization seed system.
  - Mastering the automation of automation.
  - Achieving Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI).
  - Develop decentralized systems that make technototalitarianism impossible.
  - Innovate in creating compact end-to-end hardware automation systems to make hardware and robotics, fully autonomously.
